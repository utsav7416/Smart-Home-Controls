Features
Device Control: Remotely manage and monitor all your smart home devices.

Toggle Device State: Easily switch devices ON or OFF with a single tap.

View Active Devices: Get an at-a-glance overview of all currently active devices in your home.

Adjust Settings: Fine-tune device properties like brightness for lights, speed for fans, temperature for AC, or power levels for appliances.

Energy Analytics: Gain deep insights into your energy consumption.

Interactive Graphs: Visualize your energy usage patterns over time through dynamic charts showing hourly, daily, and weekly consumption.

Consumption Breakdown: See how much energy each device or category consumes, helping you identify high-usage areas.

Cost Optimization Reports: Access summaries and predictions to understand potential savings and optimize your energy expenditure.

Geofencing: Automate your home based on your location.

Location-Based Actions: Set up virtual boundaries to trigger automatic device actions (e.g., turn off lights when you leave, pre-cool the house when you're almost home).

Smart Routines: Create custom automation routines linked to geofence entry or exit events.

Anomaly Detection: Our system proactively identifies unusual energy consumption patterns or device behavior, alerting you to potential issues or inefficiencies that might be costing you extra.

Profile Management: Personalize your app experience, manage your connected devices, and customize notification preferences from a dedicated section.

Informational Pages: Access essential information including "About Us" for project details, "Terms" for usage policies, and "Contact Us" for support.

Machine Learning Algorithms
Our application integrates advanced machine learning algorithms to deliver intelligent and predictive functionalities:

Random Forest Regressor: Predicts energy consumption using historical data and environmental factors.

Isolation Forest: Detects anomalies in energy consumption patterns.

Ridge Regression: A linear model supporting stable energy prediction.

MLP Regressor (Multi-Layer Perceptron): An advanced neural network for complex non-linear energy data prediction.

DBSCAN: Clusters location points for precise geofencing automations.
